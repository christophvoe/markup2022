## Working with equations

We define a set of equations as

\begin{gather}
a = b + c^2,\\
a - c^2 = b,\\
\textrm{left side} = \textrm{right side},\\
\textrm{left side} + \textrm{something} \geq \textrm{right side}, 
\end{gather} 

for all something > 0.

## Aligning the same equations

Aligning the equations by the equal sign gives a much better view into the placements
of the separate equation components

\begin{align} 
a &= b + c^2,\\
a - c^2 &= b,\\
\textrm{left side} &= \textrm{right side},\\
\textrm{left side} + \textrm{something} &\geq \textrm{right side},
\end{align}

## Omit equation numbering

\begin{align*} 
a &= b + c^2\\
a - c^2 &= b\\
\textrm{left side} &= \textrm{right side}\\
\textrm{left side} + \textrm{something} &\geq \textrm{right side}
\end{align*}

## Ugly alignment

Some components do not look well, when aligned. Especially equations with different
heights and spacing. For example,

\begin{align} 
E = mc^2, \\
m =  \frac{E}{c^2}, \\
c =  \sqrt{\frac{E}{m}}, \\
\end{align}

Take that into account. 

## Discussion

This is where youâ€™d normally give your audience a recap of your talk, where you could
discuss e.g. the following

- Your main findings
- The consequences of your main findings
- Things to do
- Any other business not currently investigated, but related to your talk
